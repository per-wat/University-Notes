**Discuss With Dr. Hamwira**

We need to think bout our title  
My idea is splitted into 2

> ### Idea 1
> **Improving Sleep with Smart Home Automation using Brain Computer Interface**
> Creating an environment to help user fall asleep easier based on their brain activity
> Develop a system where it analyse user's brain and try to find the best way to help to sleep
> Things need to consider:
> - How can we detect one is cannot sleep
> -

### Reading Articles

***

> ### Brain Computer Interface Advancement in Neurosciences: Applications and Issues
> *Mudgal S. K., Sharma S. K., Chaturvedi J., Sharma A.*
>
> **Introduction**  
> - Brain Computer Interface (BCI) provides direct communication between brain and bio-monitoring devices
> - Does not involve any muscle or neuromuscular pathway to communicate
> - Good to utilized in a paralyzed but conscious patient
> - Before BCI used for physically disabled patients -> hand free devices
> 
> **What is BCI**  
> A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that receives, analyzes, and transfer the signals generated from brain into output commands in real world to accomplish a particular task
>
> **Types of BCIs**  
> 
> *13. BCI and Entertainment & Games*
> - Flying helicopters to any point either 2D or 3D world
> - The Brain Arena
>   : Football video game where can score goal by imagine left or  right hand movement
>   : Player that is more relax and calmer usually wins
>   : Could help with reduce stress and learn self control
>
> **BCIs Drawback**
>
> *1. Neuro-psycho-physiological Issues*
> - Anatomy of brain could be too diverse
> - Some people genetically couldn't produce sufficient signals for it to work
> - Psychological like attention, memory, fatigue, stress, emotion.
> - Person characteristics like age, gender, life-style
>
> *2. Technological Issues*
>
> *3. Ethical Issues*
