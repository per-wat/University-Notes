**Discuss With Dr. Hamwira**

I need to think bout my title  
My idea is splitted into 2

> ### Idea 1
> **Improving Sleep with Smart Home Automation using Brain Computer Interface**  
> Creating an environment to help user fall asleep easier based on their brain activity  
> Develop a system where it analyse user's brain and try to find the best way to help to sleep  
> Things need to consider:  
> - How can we detect ones cannot sleep
> - How to know what part of the environment to change
>   - Do we just try and error until finding the nice spot and save the data???
>   - Or we can try to use the brain activity to find specific variable to change
> - Sleep stage based on EEG activity article [The Process of Falling Asleep p. 3-8](https://sci-hub.se/10.1053/smrv.2001.0145)
> - Cannot access article but might helpful [Differences between EEG during thermal discomfort and thermal displeasure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360132321006211)

> ### Idea 2
> **Smart Home Control using Brain Computer Interface**  
> Able to control IoT or smart home appliances by thinking  
> Develop system to connect user's brain to their home  
> For example, user just think to lower the AC, then it will do it  
> Integration with existing smart home hub like *Google Assitant, Alexa*  
> Things need to consider:  
> - Can we distinguish percisely what user want from the EEG
> - Does the intergration can be done from brain signal into words/voices that can be understood by them
> - One cool article about [EEG microstate when imagine movement of hand](https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/24699322.2017.1389404)
> - Controlling virtual assistant using BCI [article](assets/BCI-control-of-virtual-assistant.pdf)
> - [Telephatic Virtual Assistant](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8824886)
> - [BCI in VR and IoT](https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2809453)

And remember to ask how do we demo it
- Do we need to have every appliances during showcase
- How can we demonstrate that our tech is working

Last but not least ask **what he want in the FYP 1 report**

### Reading Articles

***

> ### Brain Computer Interface Advancement in Neurosciences: Applications and Issues
> *Mudgal S. K., Sharma S. K., Chaturvedi J., Sharma A.*
>
> **Introduction**  
> - Brain Computer Interface (BCI) provides direct communication between brain and bio-monitoring devices
> - Does not involve any muscle or neuromuscular pathway to communicate
> - Good to utilized in a paralyzed but conscious patient
> - Before BCI used for physically disabled patients -> hand free devices
> 
> **What is BCI**  
> A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that receives, analyzes, and transfer the signals generated from brain into output commands in real world to accomplish a particular task
>
> **Types of BCIs**  
> 
> *13. BCI and Entertainment & Games*
> - Flying helicopters to any point either 2D or 3D world
> - The Brain Arena
>   : Football video game where can score goal by imagine left or  right hand movement
>   : Player that is more relax and calmer usually wins
>   : Could help with reduce stress and learn self control
>
> **BCIs Drawback**
>
> *1. Neuro-psycho-physiological Issues*
> - Anatomy of brain could be too diverse
> - Some people genetically couldn't produce sufficient signals for it to work
> - Psychological like attention, memory, fatigue, stress, emotion.
> - Person characteristics like age, gender, life-style
>
> *2. Technological Issues*
>
> *3. Ethical Issues*
